				<h1>A Little About Me</h1>
				<p>
					Hello, and welcome to my ePorfolio. My name is Javiell Reeves. I am a class of 2025 graduate of
					Selma High School. I'm currently finishing up my final semester at Wallace Community College Selma
					to recieve my associate's degree in Computer Information Systems. I am an incoming collge freshmen
					who is attending Tennessee State University for Electrical Engineering. When I first started
					searching for a career path I decided on computer engineering. I realized when I started taking CIS
					classes at Wallace that coding wasn't the most interesting to me so I switched to electrical
					engineering. I love doing hands on activities so I want my occupation to be based on that. I am big
					on God and family. I would be nowhere without God. I can't start my day without thinking him for
					everything. My family, where do I even start, they raised me to be who I am today.
				</p>
				<p>
					On this page, you will see five different pages including the one you are on now which is the "Home"
					Page. Next is the "Coursework" page where you will be able to see the classes I have taken at WCCS.
					Then, there is the "Hobbies" page ,which is my favorite, you will find what I do outside of school
					work and maybe even a song you might want to add to your playlist. Last but not least is the
					"Contact Me" page where you will put your information so I can reach you. Thank you again for
					stopping by!
